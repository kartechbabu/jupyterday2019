# UBC JupyterDay 2019

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is web application for producing computational narratives: a notebook in the browser which runs code and renders text, mathematical notation, images and videos. Jupyter notebooks are a powerful open source tool for scientific computing and reproducible research.

[The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)](http://www.pims.math.ca/) hosts Jupyter notebooks on [syzygy.ca](http://syzygy.ca/) and JupyterDay is an opportunity for instructors, researchers and students at UBC to share their Jupyter experiences and to learn about new Jupyter tools.

* Tuesday August 27, 2019
* 10am-4pm
* Undergraduate Mathematics Computer Lab, LSK 121
